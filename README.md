The Online Examination Interface is a Java-based application designed to simulate an online exam experience. It offers a secure login system for users, allowing them to access their accounts and participate in exams. Once logged in, users can view and answer multiple-choice questions, with a built-in timer for each exam. The system auto-submits the exam after the time limit is reached. Additionally, users can update their profile and password securely. The system provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface while demonstrating key Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, data handling, and managing real-time user input.
